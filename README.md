# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is the first challenge for my MSU bootcamp.

For this challenge i must refactor the code to make it more accessible by using semantic HTML elements, follow a logical structure of styling and positioning, adding 'alt' attributes to images, and add a concise and descriptive title.
